> Version 1.08 of the profile was just released (2025-06-17), bringing new features and performance improvements.  
> Updates to this guide comming soon.

## Setup

We will be using UEVR to make _Hogwarts Legacy_ run in VR.  
We will also use a profile that allows for 1st person perspective, a motion controlled wand, and casting spells by drawing glyphs in the air.  
You can also still use an Xbox controller and toggle into 3rd person.

[(_super quick instructions_)](super-quick-instructions.md)

This guide assumes you understand how to
1. Download programs and files from the internet
2. Install software on your computer
3. Extract the contents of a zip file
4. Connect your chosen VR headset to your computer to play VR games

<br>

UEVR is a tool that injects VR support into Unreal Engine games that do not have it natively.

UEVR website <https://uevr.io>

UEVR Github <https://github.com/praydog/UEVR>

To use this directly, see instructions here --> [Praydog's injector + Nexus Mods](standard-injector-instructions.md)

<br>

"Unreal Easy Injector" (previously known as UEVR Deluxe) is a tool derived from UEVR that simplifies the process of setting up UEVR by providing profiles for specific games and presenting a cleaner/simplified user interface.

Unreal Easy Injector website <https://uevrdeluxe.org>

Unreal Easy Injector GitHub <https://github.com/oduis/UEVRDeluxe>

To use this method, read on.

### Installing Unreal Easy Injector

Go to the [website](https://uevrdeluxe.org) and click on "Download latest release"

![](images/01-unreal-easy-injector-homepage.png)

<br>

Clicking this link will take you to the GitHub release page.  
After the release notes, under "Assets", click on the **UEVREasyInjector.exe** to download it.

Take the latest version. This screenshot might be outdated.

![](images/02-uevr-easy-injector-v1.3-download.png)

You can also get a **direct download** of the latest EXE by clicking here  
https://github.com/oduis/UEVRDeluxe/releases/latest/download/UEVREasyInjector.exe

<br>

Once the installer is downloaded, run it.

Windows Defender might warn you about running the installer.  
Click "More info" and "Run anyway".

DISCLAIMER: use your own judgment about running software from the internet.

![](images/02.2-windows-protected-your-pc-run-anyway.png)

### Installing the 1st Person Profile

Now run the installed program.  
It should be in your Start Menu or Desktop as "Unreal VR Easy Injector"

![](images/02.3-uevr-easy-injector-icon.png)

<br>

Choose Hogwarts Legacy

![](images/03-uevr-easy-select-game.png)

<br>

Press "Search profile"

![](images/04-uevr-easy-profile-select-button.png)

<br>

Select the 1<sup>st</sup> Person profile created by Pande4360, jbusfield, DJ  
Then press "Install"

![](images/05-uevr-easy-profile-selection-and-install.png)

This profile is created by Pande4360, jbusfield, DJ  
and is therefore called the PJD profile.  
It can also be downloaded from Nexus Mods  
https://www.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/mods/2264

You can play Hogwarts Legacy in VR without this profile.  
It will be in 3rd person, controlled by your Xbox controller, or keyboard and mouse.  
If you want to play in 1st person with motion controls, then you need this profile.  
Also see [Profile Configuration Options](#profile-configuration-options) for additional settings you can change provided by this profile.

### Connect your VR headset

Connect your VR HMD (head mounted display) to your PC.

I have Meta Quest 3, using Virtual Desktop ‚Äì a paid, wireless option.

If you do too, be sure to set the OpenXR Runtime to **VDXR** in the Virtual Desktop Streamer app on your PC.  
And also ensure that Open**X**R is selected in UEVR Easy Injector under "How is your VR headset connected to the PC?"

_Even if you own Hogwarts Legacy on Steam._

This is important for the VR injection to work.

![](images/06-virtual-desktop-options.png)
![](images/07.1-uevr-easy-openxr-for-vd.png)

<br>

If instead you use Meta Link (wired) or Meta Air Link (wireless), that's fine too.  
For these optionals also, ensure that Open**X**R is selected in UEVR Easy Injector under "How is your VR headset connected to the PC?".

<ins>However, if you use SteamLink with SteamVR, then you must choose "Open**V**R, linking via SteamVR"</ins>  
The difference is in that one letter: the "V" instead of the "X".

![](images/07-uevr-easy-openvr-for-steam.png)

<br>

| VR HMD to PC connection | Set Runtime to | Note                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Meta Link (USB)         | OpenXR         | Even if you own Hogwarts Legacy on Steam                                                                   |
| Meta Air Link           | OpenXR         | Even if you own Hogwarts Legacy on Steam                                                                   |
| Virtual Desktop         | OpenXR         | Also set **VDXR** in the Virtual Desktop Streamer app on your PC. Even if you own Hogwarts Legacy on Steam |
| SteamLink               | OpenVR         | With a "V", not an "X"                                                                                     |

There is no need to use SteamVR if you are already connected to your PC with Virtual Desktop or Meta Link or Air Link.

<br>

If you have another HMD that's not Quest, it should also work.  
But I have no experience with it.

### Injecting

Keep the "Unreal VR Easy Injector" window open.

Start **Hogwarts Legacy** as you normally would. Through Steam or Epic or wherever.

Wait for the game to load and enter the character/save-slot selection screen.

Put on your HMD again, if you took it off, and ensure it is still connected to your desktop.

Now, with the Hogwarts Legacy window in focus, press `Ctrl + Alt + U` on your keyboard to inject VR into the game.

There might be a few seconds of darkness. Be patient. But then you will be immersed in the wonderful Wizarding World!

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

<br>

Use the left thumb-stick to move the curser and select your character with the [A] button on your right controller.

If you are starting a new game, there is a rollercoaster at Gringotts early on.  
While this is super cool to experience in VR, it is also known to crash the game.  
So after enjoying it once, you might have to play through that part without VR to progress.

<br>

If the `Ctrl + Alt + U` keyboard shortcut is not working, or you just don't want to use it, you can also tab-out of the fullscreen game (`Alt + Tab`) to see the Easy Injector window, and press "Start / Inject game" there.

![](images/08-uevr-easy-inject-button.png)

## Troubleshooting

0Ô∏è‚É£
Nothing's happening? üò≠  
Dont worry.  
Use `Alt + Tab` to focus the Easy Injector window.  
Press "Stop Game".  
Then "Start / Inject game" again.  
Should work the 2<sup>nd</sup> time.  

But this should be fixed in version `1.7.2.0+` of UEVR Easy Injector.

<br>

1Ô∏è‚É£
If HMD shows a black screen and everything freezes, then **turn off Frame Generation** in the game's settings.  
This is _not_ the same as "space warp"/SSW/ASW.

<br>

2Ô∏è‚É£
Turn off **HAGS** (Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling) in Windows settings and restart your computer.

<br>

3Ô∏è‚É£
Did you forget to set the proper runtime in UEVR Easy Injector?  
Based on how you connect your HMD to your PC
1. OpenXr - for Meta Link, Virtual Desktop (even if you own Hogwarts Legacy on Steam)
2. OpenVr - for SteamVR

<br>

4Ô∏è‚É£
Not in 1st person?  
Press [F1] on your keyboard.  
See [Profile Configuration Options](#profile-configuration-options) for other function keys provided by the PJD profile.

<br>

5Ô∏è‚É£
Motion controls not working?

Menus do not have motion controls.  
Instead, use the analog-stick on the left controller to move the cursor.

For Valve Index controllers, try this  
https://github.com/mark-mon/uevr-index-controls

If your copy of Hogwarts Legacy is from the Epic Games Store, then see the [Epic Games Store](#epic-games-store) section.  
You need to remove a file from the game directory.

<br>

6Ô∏è‚É£
I'm moving in the wrong direction! Help!  
By default, movement is set to follow the direction you point your wand, i.e. the motion controller.  
Change this temporarily in game by pressing the `F3` key to cycle between the modes, as specified by the profile authors:
1. Manual direction mode - rotate character direction with analog stick only. does not matter where you look or where you point your motion controllers. probably good for seated experience
2. Head/HMD based direction mode - my choice
3. Hand/Controller direction mode - i guess some people like this

To persist your chosen mode, so that it is used each time you start and inject, you must edit a file in the profile.  
`%appdata%\UnrealVRMod\HogwartsLegacy\plugins\ue4ss\Mods\VRFP\scripts\config.lua`
```lua
--[[
Locomotion Mode
0 = Manual direction mode
1 = Head/HMD based direction mode
2 = Hand/Controller direction mode
]]--
locomotionMode = 1
```

<br>

7Ô∏è‚É£
Why is the [B] button not going back in menus?  
Why is the [X] button dodging and not interacting?  
See [Swapped B and X buttons](#swapped-b-and-x-buttons)

<br>

8Ô∏è‚É£
Cracked versions of the game do not work!

## Performance

Game is very laggy?

There are lots of settings to play with

Turn off ray-tracing

Turn graphics preset down to Low

Try DLSS on and see if it helps

If the in-game settings don't get you a frame-rate that you find acceptable, then lower the resolution and/or bit-rate in the settings of your PC link software (Virtual Desktop, Meta Link, SteamVR, etc.)  
A restart of the game is likely required

Remember, this game was not meant to run in VR. It is not optimized for it at all. It's already hardware intensive when flat 4K at 60 fps, and we're shoving VR down its throat. That means everything is rendered twice, once for each eye's perspective, at higher resolutions and higher frame-rate.

## Controls

### D-Pad

Rest your right thumb to the left of the [A] and [B] buttons  
There is a touch sensor there. Similar to how the buttons and analog-stick also sense that your finger is resting on it but not pressing.

![](images/09-quest-3-controller-thumb-rest-highlight.jpg)
![](images/10-quest-3-controller-thumb-on-thumb-rest.jpg)

The left analog-stick (on the left controller) will now function as a Direction Pad, while you continue to hold the right thumb-rest.

This is known as D-shifting. Mode-shift for the d-pad.

<details>
<summary>Expand for further details</summary>

> The quest controllers do not *actually* have a direction pad, aka d-pad, like an xbox controller.  
> Instead, we must emulate one.  
> Quest controllers have thumb-sticks, aka analogue-sticks, so we can use those like a d-pad.
>
> But if the stick is always acting as a d-pad, then we cannot use that stick for analogue input.  
> So by default, the stick acts as a stick. And only acts as a d-pad when you rest your thumb on the capacitive thumb-rest as shown in the guide picture.
>
> This concept is known as "d-shift".  
> As in, *shifting* the mode/behavior of the stick to act as a d-pad temporarily.
>
> This is the only use of the thumb-rest for this UEVR profile of this game.

</details>

UEVR has settings in its advanced "Inputs" tab to change this

1. Swap hands (left thumb-rest, right analog-stick)
2. Make a thumb-stick always the d-pad
3. D-shift when lifting the controller close to your head

What the d-pad does is the same as in the flat game (non-VR)

‚óÄ (left) _Revelio_ spell  
‚ñ∂ (right) Spell select menu  
üîª (down) Health (wiggenweld potion)  
üî∫ (up) Reveal path to tracked objective or location (see map)

### Wand

Move your right hand and the wand moves (motion controlled)

Can't see it? Try pressing the trigger to cast a spell.  
If it gets detached from your controller and stuck in the world, then just "grab your right ear": hold the right controller up to your right ear near  your HMD and press the grip button.  
If it still doesn't appear, you may need to restart the game.

Cast other spells by holding the trigger and moving the analog-stick up/down/left/right to cast the corresponding spell as seen on the HUD. This is a special feature of this PJD profile.  
The buttons [A] [B] [X] [Y] also work to cast spells, just like in flat mode (non-VR).

To **open chests** or collect **field guide pages** or otherwise interact with things, point the wand at it and press [X]  
You might find this a bit finicky. Get close enough to the object. Or maybe you're too close. Slowly rotate your hand up/down and left/right until you can see the button prompt.

Remember, we're grafting first-person VR motion controls onto a third-person free-camera game  
It's not going to be perfect  
Let's be happy how lucky we are to have this at all  
To quote Louis CK about airplanes, "You're sitting in a chair‚Ä¶ in the SKY!"

#### Glyph Gestures

Press F7 on your keyboard to enable spell-casting using gestures.

Glyphs are shown in the game's spell management menu (d-pad right).  
Hover the curser over a spell to see what glyph to draw to cast that spell.  
The thicker and sparklier part of each line is its start, and it tapers off to its end.

--> [Screenshots of all glyphs](images/glyph-gestures/) <--

To cast spells...  
Go out of the menu.  
**Hold right trigger and draw the glyph in the air.**  
Time will slow down while you draw.  
Release the trigger and the spell will be cast.

The length of the lines you draw is not as important as the angle between the lines.

Tips from [profile author 'jbusfield' ‚Äî 2025-03-05](https://discord.com/channels/747967102895390741/1073648949057048628/1346903324703723543)
> Glyphs are detected based on the angles between one line you draw and the next.  
> So if you want to draw a box for reparo, draw straight up, straight right, straight down, then straight left.  
> Be very deliberate with your strokes.  
> If the drawing system does not detect that what you have drawn so far will result in a valid glyph, then it will stop detecting and vibrate your controller as you saw in your first attempt.  
> Drawing direction goes from the thick end of the line to the thin end in the examples in the spell menu.

<br>

For Glyph Gestures to be enable each tine you start the game and inject, you must edit a file in the profile.  
`%appdata%\UnrealVRMod\HogwartsLegacy\plugins\ue4ss\Mods\VRFP\scripts\config.lua`
```lua
--[[
Gesture Mode
0 = No gestures
1 = Spells can be cast by drawing glyphs. Wrist flick casts previous spell
]]--
gestureMode = 1
```

#### Epic Games Store

If your installation of Hogwarts Legacy is from the Epic Games Store, then motion controls might not work at first.

A suggested fix is to remove the file  
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Hogwarts Legacy\Phoenix\Binaries\Win64\EOSSDK-Win64-Shipping.dll"

Rename it or move it to another folder.

‚ö† WARNING: without this file, you may experience issues connecting to your WB Games account and installing official mods.

These will all be temporary changes. They will not persist between game sessions.  
To persist your settings, so that they are used each time you start and inject, you must edit a file in the profile.

### Menu & Map

Left controller "system" button opens the menu.  
Hold for a second and release to open the map.

Menu cursor is controlled with the analog-stick. Not motion control.

If using **SteamVR**, then the "system" button will bring up the SteamVR overlay/dashboard.  
So you need to disable that in SteamVR settings.

For some reason, this option only appears in the desktop window, not in the VR dashboard.  
Your HMD still needs to be connected. And show "Advanced Settings".

### Swapped [B] and [X] buttons

By default, UEVR maps the [B] button of your right-hand motion controller to act as the [X] button of an Xbox controller.  
In Hogwarts Legacy, this is used to interact with objects, or cast the spell assigned to the West slot.

UEVR also maps the [X] button of your left-hand motion controller (for Valve Index, that's the other [A] on your left-hand) to act as the [B] button of an Xbox controller.  
In Hogwarts Legacy, this is used to dodge, cast the spell assigned to the East slot, or go back in a menu.

If instead you want the button labeled [B] to act as [B] and the button labeled [X] to act as [X], or make any other button binding changes, you can do that in [UEVR settings](#open-uevr-settings-in-game).

In the "Runtime" tab, expand the "Bindings" section, which is at the bottom of "OpenXR Options" and directly above "Overlay Options".

If you have a Meta Quest, then you can put this json file [_interaction_profiles_oculus_touch_controller.json](_interaction_profiles_oculus_touch_controller.json)  
directly into your UEVR profiles directory for Hogwarts Legacy (`%appdata%\UnrealVRMod\HogwartsLegacy`)  
and it will override the default bindings.  
This is the same as if you had changed the bindings in the UEVR settings yourself.

The important bits are these:
```json
{
    "action": "bbuttonright",
    "path": "/user/hand/left/input/x/click"
},
{
    "action": "bbuttontouchright",
    "path": "/user/hand/left/input/x/touch"
},
...
{
    "action": "abuttonleft",
    "path": "/user/hand/right/input/b/click"
},
{
    "action": "abuttontouchleft",
    "path": "/user/hand/right/input/b/touch"
}
```

<br>

With the PJD profile, "up" on the right analog-stick will jump, and "down" will dodge.  
So you don't have to remap the [B] and [X] buttons to dodge well, if you don't want to.

## Miscellaneous

### Open UEVR Settings In-Game

Press both analog-sticks simultaneously.  
Or press the "Insert" [INS] key on your keyboard.

Press again to close.

If the menu does not appear before you, then it might be behind you or to the side.  
Try turning your head to look around.  
Or recenter your view. On Quest, do that by holding the Meta button.

At the top-left of the floating settings window, check the "Show Advanced Options" checkbox to see even more things to fiddle with.

### HUD following hand instead of head

Open UEVR settings

Go to "Runtime" tab

A "nightly build" is like a beta version. It includes whatever work was done on the source-code that day, even if it's broken or otherwise not ready for stable release. The advantage of using these is that some bugs might be fixed and some new features added. But don't complain if it doesn't work.
